### **Going assumptions that could use clarification**
[Documentation](https://github.com/visioneval/VisionEval/blob/master/sources/modules/VESimHouseholds/inst/module_docs/CreateHouseholds.md#createhouseholds-module) on the CreateHouseholds Module refers to group quarters population as "households" although, by definition GQ pop is population (not households) that is different than population found in households. The text saying, "_group quarters_ households (i.e. persons in group quarters such as college dormatories)," while confusing, seems to indicate these are not actual households or groupings of persons by GQ facility, nor groupings of persons of by common unit within a GQ facility (like a dorm room), but in fact persons as the unit. This is confirmed by this table asking for age--which is a population variable, not a facility or unit variable. The example of dormitories and the fact that this is a strategic model interested in travel outcomes, points to GQ "households" or population that is non-institutional. Institutional GQ population like those living in correctional or nursing facilities will not be leaving the facilities for travel. used in the documentation points to non-institutuional group quarters population. The outputs table [shown later in the Module documentation](https://github.com/visioneval/VisionEval/blob/master/sources/modules/VESimHouseholds/inst/module_docs/CreateHouseholds.md#datasets-produced-by-the-module) lists a variable named `NumGq` described as "Number of people in non-institutional group quarters." This would seem to confirm that mentions of group quarters in the model are always going to be the population found in non-institutional group quarters.

Presumably the static PUMA level non-institutional GQ will mean that the simulated population for the model will not change either, or not significantly. While we have the data at the block level, it will likely make more sense to vary scenarios at the PUMA level, since block group levels will be more tedious to implement.

### **Sourcing - GQ Tables for Population**
For the forecast, we've adapted to 2019 a GQ pop dataset by population derived from the 2010 Decennial Census that details GQ pop by block, facility type, age, and sex. The adaptation involved adjustments from statistically significant ACS change over the decade and information on some facilities from county contacts and alternative sources such as Wikipedia. The 2019 data can be used both for the base and horizon years as the assumption we've worked with--in the absence of a group quarters forecasting model, is that the GQPop will be static into the future. This is not a great assumption on the institutional end due to the aging population and potential for changes in justice system policies, but perhaps it's not as bad for the non-intitutional GQ pop. Military barracks population fluctuates with deployments overseas and base realignments, but static assumtions aren't unreasonable in the absence of information. Dormitory population could be something to explore adjustments to based on potential for future trends in online learning and non-traditional higher-ed shifts.

That said, starting with a static GQ pop makes a lot of sense for now. A script for this can summarize the block data table (placed in the project's Postgres database) to block groups and more detailed age corhorts in the table to the six for VisionEval for non-instititional facility types only (`N5`, `N6`, `N7`).

### Sourcing - 🏙️ UrbanSim Model Outputs
This is an area where UrbanSim produces its own simulated population. Rerunning the UrbanSim populations results as PUMA level control totals for different synthesize to generate different results doesn't make sense unless we feel the VisionEval model will alter the ages in a better way than UrbanSim that will better reflect the scenarios we're working with.
